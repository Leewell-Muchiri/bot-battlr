## Core Deliverables
As a user, I should be able to:

    - See profiles of all bots rendered in `BotCollection`.
    - Add an individual bot to my army by clicking on it. The selected bot should
    render in the `YourBotArmy` component. The bot can be enlisted only **once**.
    The bot **does not** disappear from the `BotCollection`.
    - Release a bot from my army by clicking on it. The bot disappears from the
    `YourBotArmy` component.
    - Discharge a bot from their service forever, by clicking the red button marked
    "x", which would delete the bot both from the backend and from the
    `YourBotArmy` on the frontend.
